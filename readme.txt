====================
Alfresco SDK Release
====================

Welcome to the Alfresco SDK Release.

The Alfresco SDK provides support for developers who wish to extend or customise 
the Alfresco platform.

It's been designed for the developer to get developing with minimal fuss for the 
following development scenarios:

   1. Developing Alfresco Repository plug-ins such as:
          * Custom Actions / Conditions
          * Custom Aspects
          * Custom Transformers 
   2. Developing Applications against a standalone Alfresco server via Alfresco's 
      Web Service API
   3. Embedding Alfresco into existing Applications via Alfresco's Java Foundation 
      API or standards-compliant JCR API 


Typically, the SDK is used stand-alone, but an Alfresco Release Installation is
also required if performing any of the following:

   1. Customising the Alfresco Web Client
   2. Testing a custom Application that connects to a remote Alfresco Server
   3. Deploying a tested custom plug-in to a remote Alfresco Server 


The SDK is not designed for re-building Alfresco i.e. it does not provide full
build scripts and artifacts, therefore if you wish to develop bug fixes or 
extend the core functionality of the Alfresco platform, you should use the full 
Alfresco development environment provided in the Alfresco SVN Repository.
